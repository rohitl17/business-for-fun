# 📌 Value Props: Create a Product People Will Actually Buy  
### Notes from Harvard Innovation Labs (YouTube)

This video provides a structured framework for developing a compelling value proposition by shifting founders away from obsessing over their solution and toward deeply understanding the customer's problem, context, and alternatives.

## 1. The Value Proposition Framework (VP)

A strong Value Proposition starts *not* with the technology or idea, but with the **problem being solved**.  
The speaker introduces three foundational questions:

### The 3 Core Questions
1. **Who is the customer?**  
   Identify the specific individual (or group) whose problem you are solving. Avoid broad categories.

2. **What is the Job-To-Be-Done (JTBD)?**  
   What are they trying to accomplish? What outcome are they seeking?

3. **What is the cost of the status quo?**  
   Understand the pain of their current solution. If the current process isn’t costly enough, customers won’t switch.

> The value proposition becomes clear only when these three questions align.

## 2. Differentiating the User and the Customer  

Many products—especially in B2B—serve **two different personas**:

### User  
- Uses the product daily  
- Example: Analyst, nurse, operations staff  

### Customer  
- Makes the purchasing decision and pays  
- Example: Manager, department head, CFO  

A product must appeal to *both*.  
- The **user** needs usability, speed, reduced friction.  
- The **customer** needs ROI, efficiency, and measurable improvements.

> A common failure: founders design only for the user and forget the buyer.

## 3. Understanding the Job-to-be-Done (JTBD)  

JTBD reframes the product from a feature perspective to an outcome perspective.

### A JTBD has 3 dimensions:

#### 1. Motivation  
- The fundamental reason behind the task  
- Examples: reduce stress, gain status, feel secure, get promoted

#### 2. Circumstance  
- The specific situation or context  
- Example: “I need quick access to lab data *during an experiment*.”

#### 3. Desired Outcome  
- The tangible or emotional goal  
- Examples: faster reporting, fewer errors, higher confidence, social validation

The value proposition improves dramatically when the JTBD is stated clearly and precisely.

## 4. The True Competition: The Status Quo  

Your biggest competitor is *not* another startup—it is the customer doing nothing.

### Customers evaluate switching by comparing:
- **Financial Cost**  
  Cost of current tools or processes.

- **Time Cost**  
  How long the existing workflow takes.

- **Risk Cost**  
  Potential failure or uncertainty of adopting a new solution.

- **Emotional Cost**  
  Stress, frustration, or reluctance associated with change.

> If your solution is not significantly better, the friction of switching kills adoption.

## 5. Creating 10x Value  

To convince customers to switch, your solution must deliver **10x value** in at least one core metric.

Examples of 10x improvements:
- Reduce processing time by 90 percent  
- Replace 3 tools with 1  
- Cut costs by an order of magnitude  
- Eliminate a critical failure mode entirely  

10x value creates a clear and undeniable incentive to abandon the status quo.

## 6. Crafting the Value Proposition Statement  

The speaker provides a simple template for clearly articulating the value proposition:

### Value Proposition Template
**"For [customer type] who [has pain/problem], our product [solution] provides [value/benefit]."**

Examples:
- “For lab managers who struggle with fragmented scientific data, our platform organizes and analyzes experiments in real time.”
- “For small business owners overwhelmed by manual accounting, our tool automates bookkeeping with zero setup.”

This statement becomes the foundation for sales, fundraising, and product strategy.
