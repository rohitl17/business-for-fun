# The Customer-Centric Framework

This document summarizes key insights from the Harvard Innovation Labs session **“Designing a Customer-Centric Business Model.”**  
It captures the core ideas behind building disruptive, defensible, and customer-centric business models.

## 💡 I. The Four Pillars of a Business Model

A strong business model defines how a company **creates**, **delivers**, **monetizes**, and **sustains** value.  
These components work together—not independently—to determine how the business actually operates.

### **1. Create — The Customer Value Proposition**  
**Question:** What problem are we solving?

- Defines **why customers care**.
- Clarifies the core pain point or unmet need.
- Determines whether the business has *real value* in the market.

### **2. Deliver — The Go-to-Market (GTM) Model**  
**Question:** How do we reach the customer?

- Covers channels, distribution, messaging, and onboarding.
- Answers: *Where do customers discover us? How do they buy? How do we engage them post-purchase?*

### **3. Make Money — The Cash Flow Formula**  
**Question:** What is our pricing strategy?

- Directly impacts long-term viability.
- Includes pricing model, gross margins, CAC, retention, and revenue structure.
- A cash-efficient model beats a capital-intensive one.

### **4. Sustainably — The Technology & Operations Model**  
**Question:** How do we operate for the long term?

- Technology stack + operational processes.
- Determines scalability, defensibility, and repeatability.
- Ensures the business doesn’t break as it grows.

## 🎯 II. Defining Your Core Value (The C.A.L.L.)

Before launching anything, a founder must clearly define the **essence** of the business—the single value customers truly care about.

### **C.A.L.L. = Capability of Actual Ly Leading Value**

It answers:  
**“What is the one thing we do that customers rely on us for?”**

Examples:
- “I use this because it saves me time.”
- “I use this because it integrates everything in one place.”
- “I use this because it gives me reliable insights.”

### **Why CALL Matters**
- It creates clarity for product, marketing, and sales.
- It prevents building too many features that don't matter.
- It becomes the *north star* for prioritization.

---

## 🎯 Minimum Viable Segment (MVS)

Instead of serving everyone, focus on **one narrow segment** that shares the same core need.

Why?
- You save time, money, and energy.
- You get faster product-market fit signals.
- You build stronger word-of-mouth and early traction.

**A startup dies more often from lack of focus than lack of opportunity.**

## 🧪 Case Study: Tetrascience

**Original model:** Selling scientific hardware — a capital-intensive and low-margin business.  
**Insight:** Hardware wasn’t the true value. Scientists didn’t care about the device—they cared about **simplifying scientific data analysis**.

**Pivot:**  
Shifted from a hardware business → to a **data management ecosystem** (platform + software).

### **Why the pivot worked**
- The real core value (CALL) was **managing and unifying scientific data**, not connecting instruments.
- Software enabled a more scalable GTM model.
- The business became:
  - Higher margin  
  - More defensible  
  - More customer-centric

## ✅ Takeaway

Disruptive startups don’t win because of tech alone.

They win because they build:
- The **right value**,  
- For the **right customers**,  
- Using the **right business model**,  
- Sustained by the **right operations**.

This framework helps founders stay focused on delivering *real, monetizable value*—the foundation of any enduring company.

## 📈 III. Multipliers and Levers: The Startup Secrets

To build a startup that is both successful and sustainable, founders must identify:

- **Multipliers** — mechanisms that increase revenue, reach, and adoption  
- **Levers** — mechanisms that reduce time, cost, and friction  

These two forces determine how fast and efficiently a startup can grow.

---

### **1. Product-Led Growth (PLG) — “The Slippery Model”**

PLG is about designing the product so well that it drives its own adoption.  
A “slippery” product makes it almost effortless for customers to start using it and see value.

**Characteristics of a PLG model:**
- Extremely easy to use and install  
- Low or zero cost for initial engagement  
- Provides instant value (quick aha moment)  
- Continues to deliver ongoing value without heavy onboarding  
- Integrates seamlessly into existing workflows (minimal behavior change)

**Why it’s powerful:**  
PLG is both a **multiplier** (increases adoption virally) and a **lever** (reduces acquisition and onboarding cost).

---

### **2. Strategic Pricing and Packaging**

Pricing is not just revenue — it’s a growth strategy.

**Freemium or Free Trial:**  
- Reduces friction for first-time users  
- Expands top-of-funnel adoption  
- Acts as a multiplier for growth  

**Tiering and Upsell:**  
- Offers an attractive entry-level option  
- Provides a clear path to premium tiers as usage or value grows  
- Ideal for SaaS and data-driven products  

**Key principle:**  
Your pricing should encourage **initial adoption** and **ongoing expansion**.

---

### **3. Co-Creation — The Win-Win Strategy**

Build with the community, not just for the community.

**Open Source or Community-Driven Models:**
- External users solve their own problems (reduces internal cost = lever)  
- Community contributions improve the product (multiplier)  
- Company monetizes the “convenience layer”: security, hosting, managed services, support  

**Golden Rule of Co-Creation:**  
People contribute only if it is a **win for them** — solving *their* problem, not just the company’s.

---

### **4. Strategic Partnerships — Building the “Whole Product”**

No startup can do everything. Partnerships help create a complete solution.

**Partnerships serve as:**
- **Multipliers** — increasing market reach, channels, and credibility  
- **Levers** — reducing cost by avoiding non-core product development  

**Examples:**
- Hardware + software bundle partners  
- Marketplace integrations  
- Channel partners for distribution  
- API ecosystem alliances  

Focus on your **core capability** and partner for the rest.

### **5. The Three-Ups Framework for LTV and Defensibility**

A strategy for maximizing Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) and building long-term defensibility.

**Update**
- Frequent fixes  
- Data refreshes  
- Reliability and security enhancements  
A key driver of retention.

**Upgrade**
- Major new features  
- New workflow capabilities  
- Platform expansions (e.g., AI features or mobile versions)  
Boosts user engagement and keeps competitors away.

**Upsell**
- New paid products  
- Higher-tier services  
- Value-added modules  
Directly increases revenue per customer.

**Together**, these three create compounding value and sustainable monetization.

## ✅ IV. Achieving Sustainability: The RSVP Model

A truly sustainable and defensible business model can be evaluated using the **RSVP** criteria.

### **R — Repeatable**
- Customers buy the product again or keep renewing  
- Predictable demand and usage patterns  
- Low churn

### **S — Scalable**
- Growth does not break the model  
- Unit economics hold as you acquire more customers  
- Marginal cost of serving each new user decreases over time

### **V — Valuable**
- The model itself creates value beyond the product  
- Example: a partner network, a data ecosystem, a distribution channel  
- Becomes an asset that compounds over time

### **P — Defensible**
- Competitors cannot easily replicate your advantage  
- Examples:  
  - Network effects  
  - Proprietary data  
  - Switching costs  
  - Community or marketplace ecosystems  

**Goal:** Build a business where each new customer strengthens the moat.
